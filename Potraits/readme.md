I'm only uploading portraits that are 100% finished and tested.

Regarding Usage of Portraits and Art:

- Ones that end with "A3J" are ones you can use (please credit me) - just look out for the "F2E" and "F2U".
- You may find some overlaps with the FEGBA Graphics Repo, you can use those as well, but MAKE SURE TO CREDIT THE OWNER
