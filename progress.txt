22.9.22

Quick Update. A shit ton of text has been extracted.
No point in listing anything else, since minimal work has been done.
Currently working on Hapi's height and mini-mug, and finishing the hell-hole that Dex left me with.
Text that's extracted:
- All Weapons
- All Items
- All Skills
(thanks someone123)
Tryna get a new member to the team, idk.
Still stuck with the stats formula, but I'm just lazy asf. It's a 7 chapter game, it shouldn't be too hard.
Haha. This line is 111
Hopefully I can get a playable demo out before January, at least of the first chapter and and maybe Abyss?
