A backup of the Fire Emblem: Three Houses Demake
There isn't much to say about this except don't share the link alr. Please.
Anyways, it's pretty self-explanitory. Some files might have weird names as I'm too lazy to change them just for the upload.

Now, you may ask "What is the purpose to this demake? We already have FE3H"
Well, the answer that is... accessibility.

Since a FE3H runs on a Nintendo Switch, the game can't run on consoles before its time, they simply don't have enough power. And it would take years for people to perfect Switch Emulation (hell, even emulating a PS1 and an N64 still causes problems, what makes you think we will achieve perfect switch emulation?) As the GBA runs on a lot less power, we would be able to create a "perfected" version of it, although this does come with a few comprimises.

The goal is to also allow a certain group of FE veterans to enjoy FE3H. I've come across lots of veterans who don't like the new features of it. So the game allow connects new players and old players, overall creating a sort of bridge between them, creating that perfect balance.

(Also I just wanted to play 3H on my Wii)

Alright, FAQ (except no one asked):

Q: Where can I download the mod?

A: Its not out, and it won't be for a few years. I'm literally the main contributor (with a few favors here and there).


Q: Will the rom go public?

A: That is the plan, until Nintendo pulls the trigger (keep it hush alr).


Q: Can I download all of this?

A: Yes, but that doesn't mean you can use it for your own public rom hacks. I've gotten permission from a few people to use their pixel art, and you would need to do the same. Look in credits.txt for the people you can ask.
